		<h1>Camera Types</h1>
		<h2>Instant Film</h2>
		<div>
            <p>Even though we are in the digital age, there is still a want for instant film cameras. With social media, creators can easily share pictures that are taken with their phones and instantly post on the different platforms like Instagram or Facebook. Instant cameras print photos "instantly" and people can share physical images with their loved ones. Some film packs print black and white photos so people can get that nostalgic look back when film was first created.
            </p>
        </div>
        <div class="hide">
            <p>There are so many different types of instant film cameras, from Polaroid to Fujifilm Instax. They even have different sizes between mini and full size film prints. I love the fact that some people can get a physical picture to keep as memories or even party favors.</p>

		<h2>Film Camera</h2>
		<div>
            <p>Now with film cameras that were created long ago, there are some photographers who still prefer the way film makes images look. You have to actually put film in the camera and go through the process of developing the photographs. With these cameras, you have to really know what you are doing since there is no image preview after you press the button to take a photo.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="hide">
			<p>The process does take long to do your self but if you have a place to do it, it is worth the wait. There are some film stores that will take the film and process the photos for you, but at a price.</p>

		<h2>DSLRs or Mirrorless</h2>
		<div>
            <p>DSLRs are a great type of camera when you are just starting out. There is a viewfinder that allows the photographer to see the photo after it is taken. These cameras tend to be much heavier in weight than any other type of cameras. They tend to cost less now that mirrorless can produce much better looking images.</p>
			<br>
		</div>
		<div class="hide">
			<p>Mirroless cameras are just that. The images that are produced are made without the use of mirrors in the camera itself, what you see is what you get when you point and shoot. These cameras are more expensive and the lenses cost more as well. More and more professionals are using these cameras over DSLRs, especially because they are lighter.</p>
